                A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing 
                the muscles at the sides of mouth. It is believed it take about
                80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the 
                muscles at the corner of the eyes, an action known as a "Duchenne smile". 
                Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
